# Cattle-Health-Monitoring-System---IoT-Security

The 21st century has witnessed a remarkable trans- formation driven by the Internet of Things (IoT) and smart computing. Just a decade ago, the data-powered services they offer seemed like science fiction. Today, these technologies are woven into the fabric of our lives, influencing everything from our homes (smart homes) to our commutes (autonomous vehicles) and healthcare (wearable health trackers). Agriculture is no exception. Farmers and entrepreneurs alike are adopting a range of smart devices, from sensors that monitor crop health and soil moisture to drones that automate tasks like pesticide application. As an integral part of smart farming arises the livestock health management where the parties involved remotely monitor the cattle health with the use of sensors and other devices. However, this interconnectedness comes with a risk: increased vulnerability to cyberattacks. These attacks could have a devastating impact on economies heavily reliant on agriculture. To address this challenge, this work delves into the critical issues of security and privacy within the smart farmingâ€™s livestock health ecosystem. We also proceed to obtain a comprehensive understanding on how a particular attack can affect the entire system.
